Built in Mhacks Hackathon organized by Maharashtrian Government

Basic Information :
This app is based on the theme that a farmer needs his query to be answered and they could be helped in other ways.
This app was built keeping in mind a the reluctance of acceptance of technology and illiteracy or not able to read or write or both.
This app would deliver the queries to the firebase console where query handlers would segregate them on the basis of language,urgency etc.
After the segregation the query will be sent to an expert via mail and he would reply as soon as possible.
The app is built in three languages namely English,Hindi and Marathi(Because target audience were Maharashtrian farmers).
Farmers can send their queries in form of text,audio,video and image
The reply may also contain text,audio,video and image and the farmer gets a notification on his phone when his query gets answered.
All thses stuff is done using google firebase.
Also each activity has an help button which when clicked would open a video tutorial
For the ease of farmer everything will be said in the chosen language of the farmer(till now any out of the three supported languages).
The app can be controlled by voice just by pressing one button making it more easy for the farmer to adapt.
The app takes phone number of farmer as login because making email id as an authentication method would make it complex for the farmers.
Each of the buttons are numbered one,two,three and so on and their action can be seen just by saying their corresponding number hence removing language barrier

PS: Some features of the app are not yet fully functional and just for demo purposes
